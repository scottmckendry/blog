I love tinkering with my operating system and tools. I find it a fun way to spend my time, and it helps me stay "_productive_". However, I don't like rework. I hate having to make the same changes to my configuration files on multiple machines.

In my world, it's a mix of Windows and Linux, two worlds with their own unique flavours.Â **But I have a goal**: keep my configuration and settings as harmonious as possible. My current solution is to maintain two separate repositories:

- [Windots](https://github.com/scottmckendry/windots?ref=scottmckendry.tech)Â â€“ Windows
- [Dots](https://github.com/scottmckendry/dots?ref=scottmckendry.tech)Â â€“ Linux

## The Problem

Not everything has to be identical. I'll give you an exampleâ€”I use Alacritty on Linux, but on Windows 11, the default Windows Terminal does the trick. So, there's no need to sync Alacritty with my Windots repo, right? Similarly, I don't need to duplicate my Windows Terminal configuration in my Dots repo.

I use Neovim on both platforms with an identical config. I want changes to be automatically mirrored between the two repos. IÂ _could_Â just copy the files every time I make a change. But that's boring and error-prone.

## The Solution

I came across thisÂ [GitHub action](https://github.com/dmnemec/copy_file_to_another_repo_action?ref=scottmckendry.tech)Â that looked promising. It copies files/folders from one repo to another, including logic to only copy files that have changed. Perfect!

Here's how I set it up for my Windows and Linux dotfiles repositories:

**1. Setting up a Personal Access Token (PAT)**

To allow the GitHub action to push changes to the destination repository, you'll need to create a Personal Access Token (PAT). Follow these steps to generate and configure your PAT:

- Navigate to yourÂ [Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta&ref=scottmckendry.tech)Â page in GitHub Developer Settings.
- Click onÂ **Generate new token**.
- Give your token a name and select the two repositories you want to keep in sync.

Assign the followingÂ **Repository Permissions**:

- **Contents** â€“ Read and write
- **Actions** â€“ Read only
- **Metadata** â€“ Read only

After configuring the permissions, clickÂ **Generate token**, and copy the token to your clipboard.

In each of your repositories (Windows and Linux), add the token as aÂ [secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions?ref=scottmckendry.tech#creating-secrets-for-a-repository). Name the secretÂ `SYNC_TOKEN`.

**2. GitHub Action Configuration**

With the PAT in place, you can now set up the GitHub action to automate dotfile synchronization. Here's the configuration I used for both repositories:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

name: Sync to dots

jobs:
  copy-file:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        
      - name: Sync Neovim
        uses: dmnemec/copy_file_to_another_repo_action@main
        env:
          API_TOKEN_GITHUB: ${{ secrets.SYNC_TOKEN }}
        with:
          source_file: "nvim/"
          destination_repo: "scottmckendry/dots"
          destination_folder: "/" 
          user_email: "39483124+scottmckendry@users.noreply.github.com"
          user_name: "Scott McKendry"
          commit_message: "${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}\n[skip ci]\nAutomated sync from scottmckendry/Windots"
          git_server: "github.com"
```

Copy

A few points to note about the config:

- TheÂ `commit_message`Â parameter is set to the commit message of the triggering commit, ensuring consistency across both repositories.
- IncludingÂ `[skip ci]`Â in the commit message is crucial to prevent the action from triggering repeatedly when the commit is pushed to the destination repository, avoiding an infinite loop. I've also included a note indicating the commit's origin.

## The Result

Now when I make a change to my Neovim config on either platform, the pushed changes are mirrored in both repositories, commit message and all! I can make changes on either platform without worrying about manually copying files. Mental load reduced! ðŸš€

## The Future

More and more of my config is becoming platform-agnostic. To add another file or folder in the sync, I just need to add another step to the workflow.

You can see the action "_in action_" below. Let me know what you think!
